/*
1. int : It is the type of the data that we want to insert (KEY).It can be integer, float or pair of int etc.
2. null_type : It is the mapped policy. It is null here to use it as a set. If we want to get map but not the set, as the second argument type must be used mapped type.
3. less<int> : It is the basis for comparison of two functions (others available function include less_equal, etc.)
4. rb_tree_tag : type of tree used. It is generally Red black trees because it takes log(n) time for insertion and deletion while other take linear time such as splay_tree.
5. tree_order_statistics_node__update : It is included in <tree_policy.hpp> and contains various operations for updating the node variants of a tree-based container, so we can keep track of metadata like the number of nodes in a subtree

Can perform the same operations as C++ STL set, with the addition of other extra functions in O(logn):
1. order_of_key (k) : number of items strictly smaller than k
2. find_by_order(k) : returns the iterator of the k-th element in a set (counting from zero) (in sorted order)
